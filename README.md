**First_Token**

This is the initial token I created using Solidity. It's a straightforward example demonstrating how contracts operate, along with the processes of minting and burning tokens.


**Description**
Solidity is a widely-used programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This example includes two functions that manage the minting and burning of tokens on the network.



**Execution**
To execute this program, you need an IDE that supports Solidity. I used Remix IDE, an online platform, to implement the code. Anyone can use a similar setup to deploy it.
